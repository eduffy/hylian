In this paper, we described Hylian, a system for construction
of a language-complete ASG that provides statement-level
analysis, both static and dynamic, of a {\CPP} application.
We performed various verification and validation metrics to the ASG,
including a viewer that can visualize any graph in GXL format,
to provide assurance for a developer that the ASGs that Hylian builds
correctly represent the program under investigation.
To evaluate space considerations for Hylian ASGs, we have
provided some results that describe the size of the generated
ASGs.  Our future work entails using the Hylian system to
perform transformations on the ASG, and generate {\CPP}
code for the transformed ASG.
