In this paper, we describe a system, Hylian, for construction
of a language-complete
abstract semantic graph that can be used for statement-level
analysis, both static and dynamic, of a {\CPP} application.
We begin by extending the GNU $gcc$ parser to generate parse 
trees in XML format for each of the compilation units in a {\CPP} 
application.  We then provide verification that the generated parse 
trees are structurally equivalent to the code in the original {\CPP} 
application.
We use the generated parse trees, together with an augmented version of
the {\em gcc} test suite,
to recover a grammar for the {\CPP} dialect that we parse.
%We use the recovered grammar to generate a schema for
%further verification of the parse trees and evaluate the coverage 
%provided by our {\CPP} test suite.
We then construct the Abstract Semantic Graph, ASG, by extending the 
parse tree for each compilation unit with semantic 
information derived from the parse trees and guided by the {\CPP} 
language standard.
Finally, we link the ASGs for all of the compilation units into a 
unified ASG for the entire application under study.
